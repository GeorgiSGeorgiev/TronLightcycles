# INSTALL

1. Install SFML: simply follow the official SFML tutorials. They are very good.

   1. Visual Studio (my method):

      * https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php
      * Note: If you run VS 2019, the latest available version of the SFML SDK will do the trick. It is recommended to install the 32-bit version.

      

   2. Linux:
      * https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php

2. Put the files from this repository to your project with the SFML already set.
3. Build the project (ideally from Visual Studio)
   * Note: the first loading of all of the SFML objects may take very long
