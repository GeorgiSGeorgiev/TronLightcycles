# TUTORIAL

Here you will find all of the game controls, the rules and the main goal of the game.

## Main menu and game difficulty

![The Main Menu](https://github.com/GeorgiSGeorgiev/TronLightcycles/blob/master/StartMenuImage.png)

Right after starting the program a main menu appears. There you can see the following buttons:

* Start - starts the game with the selected difficulty level
* Easy, Normal, Hard - available difficulty levels
* Quit - exits directly the game

The currently selected button is marked - it is slightly bigger and has different color. You can Start the game by selecting Start and pressing the **Enter** button. The same applies if you want to quit the game.

You can move between the different options with the **W**, **A**, **S**, **D** keys or with the **Up**, **Left**, **Down**, **Right** arrow keys.

The different difficulty levels can not be selected with the Enter button, they can be only marked. By marking the desired difficulty it is being set. These levels determine the speed of the enemy lightcycles. **Easy** means that the enemies will be exactly as fast as the player. **Normal** sets the speed of the enemy lightcycles to be slightly bigger than the speed of the player's lightcycle. The enemies have even bigger speed on **Hard**.

Pressing the **Esc** (Escape) key quits the game directly at any time (even during the gameplay).

## Starting the Game and Basic controls

![The Starting Position](https://github.com/GeorgiSGeorgiev/TronLightcycles/blob/master/TheGame.png)

After the Start is selected and the **Enter** button is pressed, the game starts. There is a short countdown in the beginning to give the player a chance to prepare. Right after the countdown ends the enemy lightcycles spawn. Their spawning points are from the both sides of the player's lighcycle. The distance between the lightcycles is randomly chosen to make the game more challenging and unpredictable. Just after the lightcycles are spawned they start moving in the same direction (up).

Just after the start of the game if you want to go faster than 4200, you will have to press the acceleration button AFTER the countdown has already finished.

* Player's lighttrace is turned off in the beginning of each round. To turn it on press the **Spacebar**. This button can also deactivate the lighttrace.

* To accelerate press **W** or the **Up** arrow. To decelerate press **S** or the **Down** arrow. **Warning!** You can not decelerate below the speed of 4200. The current speed is shown in the bottom right part of the screen. By changing direction the lightcycle slightly slows down. There is friction too. Which means that as soon as you release the acceleration button, the lightcycle will start slowing down. Its speed won't fall below 4200. Player's lightcycle has the maximum speed of 6000.

* The Player can zoom in or zoom out the camera by pressing the **Z** and **X** keys.

* Pressing the **Escape** will directly quit the game.

## Rules

![Gameplay](https://github.com/GeorgiSGeorgiev/TronLightcycles/blob/master/Gameplay.png)

The main goal is to survive until the end. Keep in mind that all of the lighttraces are deadly! You can be killed even by your lighttrace! By derezing an enemy lightcycle its lighttrace is destroyed as well.

The lightcycle arena is called The Grid and it has deadly borders, so try to not crash into them.

Try to cut-off the way of the enemy players and destroy them. There is counter of the total of remaining lightcycles in the top left corner of the screen.

Remember... Surviving sometimes may be a hard job to be done... Anyway there is a hidden feature which is very hard to be found and even harder to be used... It will help you a little bit with your survival mission.

The game itself allows you to experiment and to try out new moves and tactics. But there is a catch... You have to be fast... very fast... mind-blowingly fast...

## AI

There are 7 enemy AI lightcycles. They all try to derez (destroy) you! Keep this in mind. The AI is custom made and it can surprise you in many ways. Don't underestimate it!

## Endgame

![The End](https://github.com/GeorgiSGeorgiev/TronLightcycles/blob/master/Endgame.png)

After the last enemy has been defeated or you have been derezzed then you will see some final words. You will have to press **Enter** after that and then you are returned to the main menu. From there you can start again. The Grid will be cleared and the action can begin again.
